# RyzenMasterAutoApply
Since all the Reddit threads for this issue are closed, I created this that may help someone in the future.

Simple AutoHotkey script to apply **Profile1** in Ryzen Master.

Edit in Notepad and edit RyzenPath if required.
Compile and place shortcut to .exe in shell:startup.

May require AHK to be ran as administrator depending on install locations and user rights.
